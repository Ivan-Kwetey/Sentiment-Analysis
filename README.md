# Sentiment-Analysis
Review sentiment analysis helps understand user satisfaction and make recipe recommendations, offering insights into customer preferences, recipe quality, and menu optimization. By analyzing reviews, businesses can identify popular dishes, make data-driven decisions, and improve strategies, enhancing user experience and competitiveness.

The main problem which most review sentiment analysis tends to solve is user satisfaction and recipe recommendations. Recipe review sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for businesses in the food industry as it addresses various crucial aspects such as understanding customer preferences, assessing recipe quality, optimizing menus, and improving brand perception. By analyzing sentiments expressed in recipe reviews, businesses can gain insights into customer opinions, identify popular dishes, make data-driven decisions for menu optimization, generate personalized recommendations, and enhance marketing strategies. This analysis not only aids in improving user experience and satisfaction but also helps in staying competitive by benchmarking against rivals and refining business strategies based on customer feedback and sentiments.

My main goal is to understand how users feel about different recipes, are they generally positive, negative, or neutral? Additionally, I want to leverage sentiment analysis to identify popular recipes based on user reviews and see if sentiment analysis can enhance the accuracy of recipe recommendations for users. This project aims to uncover valuable insights into user preferences.

I'll be delving into several key areas as part of this sentiment analysis project. Firstly, I'll need to familiarize myself with various sentiment analysis techniques such as bag-of-words, and potentially learning models like SVM or Naive Bayes. Additionally, I'll focus on data preprocessing tasks such as text data cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and potentially duplications, addressing misspellings or slang in user reviews. Finally, I'll dive into model training and evaluation, which involves training a sentiment analysis model using labeled data (positive, negative, neutral) and assessing its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure the model's effectiveness in capturing user sentiment accurately.

I'll visualize the sentiment distribution across all recipes to gain insights into the overall sentiment landscapeâ€”this will help me understand if users generally feel positive, negative, or neutral towards the recipes. Next, I'll compare sentiment scores between popular and less popular recipes to determine if sentiment correlates with recipe popularity, providing valuable insights into user preferences.With timestamp I will discover trends or patterns of sentiments in the last month of the dataset.
